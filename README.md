# Learn to Build an Interpreter with Go

- Understand how interpreters work.
- Develop a basic interpreter step by step.
- Gain practical experience with Go.

## Project Overview

I will create:
- A lexer to break down the source code into tokens.
- A parser to convert tokens into an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST).
- An evaluator to execute the program represented by the AST.
