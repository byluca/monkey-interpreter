## 🌟 **Project Overview**
In this project, we'll create an interpreter for the **Monkey programming language**! 🐵 Here's what we'll build:

### 🛠️ **Components**:
1. **Lexer**: Breaks down source code into tokens.  
2. **Parser**: Converts tokens into an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST).  
3. **Evaluator**: Executes the program represented by the AST.

## 🛑 **Why Monkey?**
Monkey is a fun and minimalist language with features like:
- ✏️ C-like syntax.
- 🔢 Integers and Booleans.
- 🧮 Arithmetic operations.
- 🎛️ First-class and higher-order functions.
- 🗂️ Data structures like strings, arrays, and hashes.
